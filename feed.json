			"content_html": "As you may have noticed, it was nearly 18 months between the first post and the second one. Turns out _more coming soon_ was a lie. Who knew a young baby and a non-existent blog engine (if you can even call it that) would lead to no posts, but it did. Along the same lines, working 8-10 hour days writing technology doesn't leave me very motivated to experiment and write about it. I seem to come home looking to exercise a different part of my brain.",

			"content_html": "I had originally started writing this as a sort-of journal regarding the thoughts, feelings and emotions I had at the time. I wanted to write down everything about the ordeal and any details that related to it. If parts of the post seem too detail-oriented, that is likely because it was a memorable detail to me, even if it does not make for a more fluid read. I tried to focus on how I felt and what I was thinking (as much as possible in hindsight), even if those emotions did not make sense. Hopefully it does not detract from the story too much.",
