# Donut Power Rankings:
Ranking the best donuts in the world

## Introduction
This is my on-going list of the best donuts in the world. What I'm looking for in a great donut: a warm moist cake, with a firm hard crunch when biting into it. I don't do fillings (those are pastries). I'm looking for a well cooked donut, not to heavy on icing or frosting, without too many toppings. The icing and topings should conmplement the great cake donut, not be the star of the show. A well cooked plain donut can beat a regular donut with a bunch of fancy cereal or candy toppings. Obviously, these criteria give made-to-order donuts a huge advantage over your local donut store. If you're on the fence about great donuts and find a place that makes them to order, do itâ€”you'll be amazed by the difference.
