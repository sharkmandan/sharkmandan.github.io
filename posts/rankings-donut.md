# Donut Power Rankings: The Best Donuts in the World

## Introduction
This is my on-going list of the best donuts in the world. What I'm looking for in a great donut: a warm moist cake, with a firm hard outer crunch when biting into it. The icing and toppings should complement the donut, not be the star of the show. No cream or fruit filling (that's for pastries). A well cooked plain donut can beat a regular donut with a bunch of fancy cereal or candy toppings. Given these criteria a made-to-order restaurant donut has a huge advantage over local pink-box donut store. And it should. If you've never had a made to order donut, it will almost certainly change your perspective on what is a great donut.

## 1. Two Sparrows Maple Bacon
#### Chicago, IL _closed_
The bacon maple donut at 2 Sparrows is the bar with which I use to measure all other food. I've had 3 maple bacon donuts on two separate trips to Chicago (along with their cookies & cream donut on the second trip) and each time it was phenomenal. It's what I have come to expect from a perfect cake donut with the outside crunchy enough that you can you can use a knife to slice through it without smashing the donut itself. The maple glaze was sweet, but very thin adding a lot of flavor without being a thick frosting overwhelming the perfectly cooked donut. 

As I mentioned earlier, I went to 2 Sparrows on two separate trips. Despite building it up in my head in the year between, it exceeded expectations on the second visit. I was extremely disappointed when I found out they had closed, had I known in advance I would have made sure to fly out again from California. The world is not right when the best of all donuts can no longer be had.

Lastly, since Keith Law introduced me to 2 Sparrows (via Twitter), I'll leave with this his quote from [Chicago Eats](http://meadowparty.com/blog/2012/08/21/chicago-eats-2/): 
>2 Sparrows‘ maple bacon donut, which is on the short list of the best things I’ve ever eaten, not just for the bacon, but for the absolutely perfect donut at the heart of the $4 dish. The maple glaze is very sweet, like pure maple sugar, so the donut beneath it has little to no sweetness of its own, instead shining for the crispy exterior and a soft, light interior. The bacon crumbled over the top is house-cured, with the salt well balanced with the glaze’s sweetness, and some texture contrast with the soft donut. I admit the plate seemed a little gimmicky, but the execution across the board is tremendous.

## 2. Gordough's
#### Austin, TX
Gordough's in Austin, TX has a wide array of donuts with various icings and toppings. From classic icings, as well as cream cheese and honey. While toppings included combinations fruit, candy, cheese, or even fried chicken tenders. Most importantly Gordough's donuts (and toppings) were made fresh as you ordered. 

A small, metal food truck in the hot Texas sun, Gordough's is certainly worth a visit. While many of the toppings can be extreme or even overpowering for some, underneath the crazy toppings is a fresh, fantasticly cooked donut. 

 * **Cinnamon and Sugar** — One of the simpler items on the menu, the cinnamon and sugar donut is a bit lighter than the 2 Sparrows donut, more what you'd expect from a pink-box sugar donut. While not as creative as some other menu items, the simplicity highlighted the dough fried to perfection. When I became overwhelmedby some of the other flavor-rich concoctions, the cinnamon sugar is where I would return.
 * **Maple Bacon** — The bacon maple at Gordoughs was an excellent donut, but took second best. Along with the donut, the bacon is cooked fresh when ordered. The maple glaze was thin, but layer on a little thick for my taste (I ordered light maple on the second trip). While all the ingredients were great tasting, crispy bacon bits instead of full-sized strips would've been easier to eat outside with plastic silverware. All-in-all a fantastic, delicious donut, but not quite the 2 Sparrows.
 * **Cream Cheese Heath Bar** — This was a rich donut with a generous amount of heath bar chunks. I expected to be overwhelmed by the sweetness, but the layer of cream cheese in-between was not sweetened, making a fantastic companion to the sweet and crunchy Heath bar chunks. 

## 3. Blue Star
#### Tokyo, Japan
Blue Star originated in Portland (and is now in Los Angeles), we visited the location in Tokyo, which, due to the Japanese approach to perfection ended up coming back to improve the Portland location.

## 4. Anueuue Cafe
Poipu, Kauai, HI
