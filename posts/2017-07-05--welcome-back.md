## Welcome Back! 
As you may have noticed, it was nearly 18 months between the first post and the second one. Turns out _more coming soon_ was a lie. Who knew a young baby and a non-existent blog engine (if you can even call it that) would lead to no posts, but it did. Along the same lines, working 8-10 hour days writing technology doesn't leave me very motivated to experiment and write about it. I seem to come home looking to exercise a different part of my brain.

With that being said, I'm aiming to write about other, non-technical things. I'm sure there will be some technical stuff in there (I can't resist a [good tech-rant](https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks)). In order to write more often, I'll write more often, but focusing on other areas.

## BBQ, Travel, and Donuts
This winter my wife and I decided we would try out a new hobbyâ€”BBQ. We got a new smoker for Christmas (the Pit-Barrel-Cooker) and have been bbqing pretty much every weekend. I have since become a certified BBQ Judge, we have travelled to taste the world-famous Franklin Barbecue (and others). I had made a habit of journaling the noteworthy BBQ places (as I have done with several donut and ice cream places throughout the years).

We travel frequently, friends and acquaintances often ask for travel recommendations, combined with the added struggles of traveling with a small child (or children), there will hopefully be something useful for others (and some good memories for us to look back on).

## Rankings
Anytime I have one of my favorite foods (donuts, ice cream, barbecue, or steak), I'm always asked _where does this rank?_ Finally, I have the source of truth. There are several rankings posts where I can organize my thoughts, keep a record, and most importantly point people where to go for the best barbecue, donuts, etc. Although there's a lot of this sort of thing on general review sites, my expertise and attention to detail/snobbishness should give a better idea of what to expect than a general purpose site. I've already started my first post with my [donut rankings](/#/posts/rankings-donut). As I visit new interesting places, they will probably get their own short post, and the general rankings will be updated as needed.

Stay tuned, there's more coming soon! (for realz this time).
